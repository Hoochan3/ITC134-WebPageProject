                          In Conclusion 

Overall, Coding Bootcamp wins in cost, but it requires a greater time commitment compared to studying at UW where students study for four years. The program at UW is very competitive and not all students are accepted whereby, students can be accepted by numerous locations of Coding Bootcamps in Seattle. Furthermore, At UW, students study for a longer time and do the practices that they are learning in classes whereby students who finish Coding Bootcamp may need to do self-study to practice the languages and coding on their own. In other words, four years at college can be much more manageable for some than the shorter, higher intensity Coding Bootcamps.
