Work Log: Your project document must include notes from each team member at the bottom of the document identifying what was done, how long it took each and every time work is done on the project.  Here's an example notation:
2/12/2016: (Bill) Researched genesis of UNIX at Bell Labs.  Linked potential resources on project document.  (.5 hours)
Each member should place the most recent work at the top, so that each work log entry descends in chronological order.
