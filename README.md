Work Log: Your project document must include notes from each team member at the bottom of the document identifying what was done, how long it took each and every time work is done on the project.  Here's an example notation:
2/12/2016: (Bill) Researched genesis of UNIX at Bell Labs.  Linked potential resources on project document.  (.5 hours)
Each member should place the most recent work at the top, so that each work log entry descends in chronological order. 

10/22/2019 (All group members) Decided the topic and roles. (.5 hour)

10/24/2019: (Hanna) looked through the information of google doc and white paper that Jiyun uploaded to readme. Researched on other sources. Wrote the information first on word doc. Did HTML format on TextEdit and check if it works by running it since it can't be uploaded to GitHub. Researched to check what app via Mac can be uploaded to GitHub. Downloaded app like iNotepad, TextMax2, Atom, MacDown, and Coda 2 to check if they can be uploaded to GitHub but they didn't work. Just copied the HTML with content that I did on TextEdit to master branch. Copied again without HTML to master branch. (2hrs)

10/24/2019 (Jiyun) Created a wireframe for our web page. (.5 hour)

10/24/2019: (All group members) Discussed what design should look like. Created branches and did pull requests and merging. (1.5 hour)
