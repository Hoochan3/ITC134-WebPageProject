<h1>Coding Bootcamp vs CS at UW</h1>

<h1>CS at UW</h1>
<p>UW is an accredited university and well-known for its computer science program. Despite that, it is hard for students to get into the program. Taking a computer degree at UW in Seattle cost about $11,000 per year for residents and about $35,000 for out-of-state residents. The program focuses on the theory of computer science and engineering which allows the students to learn with deep understanding throughout 4 years. The graduates with CS degrees need to prove their skills in a technical interview.</p>

<h1>Coding BootCamp</h1>
<p>The cost and the duration varies at Coding Bootcamp. Coding Bootcamp is a fast-paced system that takes about 3-6 months long to teach anyone regardless of their skills up-to-date skills and languages depending on where he/she attends. The cost range from $10,000-$21,000 depending on the locations in Seattle. There are 8 Coding Bootcamps currently in Seattle:
-Flatiron School, Code Fellows, Tech Academy, Coding Dojo, Ada Dev Academy, General Assembly, Galvanize, and University of Washington Coding Boot Camp.<p>

<p>Coding Bootcampsâ€™ purpose is to give anyone a career coaching. It follows the curriculum on hands-on and project-based learning. They are not usually accredited. Unlike UW, where interview is technical, those who completed Coding Bootcamp need to prove their skills through their portfolio.</p>


<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Overall, Coding Bootcamp wins in cost, but it requires a greater time commitment compared to studying at UW for four years. The program at UW is very competitive and not all students are accepted whereby, students can be accepted by numerous locations of Coding Bootcamps in Seattle. Furthermore, At UW, students study for a longer time and have practices whereby students who finish Coding Bootcamp may need to do self-study to practice the languages and coding. In other words, four years at college can be much more manageable for some than the shorter, higher intensity Coding Bootcamps.</p>
